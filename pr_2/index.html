<p>Out of the wide aray of modules we were given for this project, I decided upon the thick ring. I think this shape is remenicent of a lot of things that we just pass by in our every day lives. I also found this one to be the most challanging, considering it will be integrated into a primarily rectangular space. </p>

<h2 class="sub-title">I am going to go around to various garbage cans around Baltimore City and extract the trash from them and document them. I want to get some places that are equidistant from each other to get a wider variety of things that can be thrown away in that area. For example, if I get a garbage can right around a McDonald's, I will mostly just find crumbled up burger bags and wrappers. I will have to look at a map and plot it out. However, I want to document trash from a different section of the city. This will include, thus far, <strong>Downtown, Inner Harbor, Charles Village, Bolton Hill, Hollin's Market, Remmington, Hampden, Pigtown, Fells Point, Canton, Highlandtown, and Lexington Market.</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="span11 next">
<h2 class="sub-title">Each unit will contain an aerial shot of each garbage can. Within that, each item will be individually broken up and photographed. The location of each can will be the top hierachy, and the titles of the objects under that. I will establish some qualitative variables for each item, but those have yet to be decided. There will probably be three to four for each. I think having a map of a radius around each garbage can I select will tie in nicely to the module as well.
